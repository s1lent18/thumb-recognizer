# Thumb-Recognition

This project is a fingerprint recognition system built using classical computer vision techniques. It leverages SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for robust feature extraction and matching, enabling accurate biometric identification without relying on deep learning. The image preprocessing pipeline includes background removal with Rembg, contrast enhancement using CLAHE, and descriptor storage in a PostgreSQL database via SQLAlchemy. The system is designed as a full-stack solution, with a Python-based API backend and a mobile front-end developed in Kotlin. The app allows users to upload fingerprint images and receive real-time match results, demonstrating efficient and practical biometric matching.
